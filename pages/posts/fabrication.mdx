## Personal explorations in wood and metal work

I enjoy woodworking and metal working. Building furniture using welded steel and wood slabs. Integrating lighting into the designs and creating space ambiance is a new undertaking and having fun with it.

I have been wood working since college and metal working since 2018. I prefer to do this for fun rather than money, building projects for friends and family.
