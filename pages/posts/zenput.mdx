## Leader in Restaurant Operations Execution Software

In my time with Zenput I have built and supported the creation of three sucessful products for the restaurant industry, used daily by companies like Chipotle, McDonalds and Dominos Pizza. In my role as a full stack developer I built web applications with React and Django, mobile applications with React Native and integrating IOT devices for restaurant monitoring. When I moved to the management side of the engineering org I led two product teams responsible for hardware integrations and software.

I had the pleasure of experiencing the growth of the company from near its inception to supporting hundreds of thousands of restaurants and millions of employees worldwide. I get to see my products in use daily at many of the large resturants chains around the world.

Zenput has been an incredible place to work and I am proud to have been a part of a hard working team that built a wonderful culture and successful business.

Zenput was acquired by Crunchtime Information Systems in June 2022.
