## A directory of maker spaces and resources in Colorado

When I moved back to Colorado I was on the search for a maker space to join and found a maker directory with lots of useful resources for my search. The non-profit that hosted the directory shut down and gave the information to another local non-profit, I am a Maker. Together with I am a Makers founder, Karen Corliss, we brought the directory back and connected with hundreds of Colorado based businesses, spaces, trainers and more all supporting the creative communities in Colorado.
