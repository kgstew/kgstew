## A member run non-profit maker space in Denver, CO

denhac provides space and tools for makers and creatives of all types. The space contains a woodshop, metalshop; laser cutting, 3d printing, cnc and textiles areas, an electronics room and workshop space for member use.

denhac is run by an all volunteer team, member elected board and board appointment managers.

I volunteer as the Ops Manager for the space.
