## A member run non-profit maker space in Denver, CO

denhac provides space and tools for makers and creatives of all types. The space contains a woodshop, metalshop; laser cutting, 3d printing, cnc and textiles areas, an electronics room and workshop space for member use.

denhac is run by an all volunteer team, member elected board and board appointment managers. The space has been around since 2008 and has grown and changed identies over its history. The space has been a great opportunity to understand the inner workings of a non-profit community maker space and how to encourage a volunteer group to participate in space improvements.

I volunteer as the Ops Manager for the space.
