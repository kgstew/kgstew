Hi there, I'm Kyle Stewart. I'm a maker, community leader, creator of tasty meals and experiences, a software engineer and people manager.

I've had the pleasure of being a part of some outstanding communities of people and great companies that have taught me much along the way. I live in Denver, Colorado, I build software systems and I support the creative community on the front range.

This site is a collection of past experiences, current projects and new explorations.
