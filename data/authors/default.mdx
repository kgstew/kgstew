Hi there, I'm Kyle Stewart. I live in Denver, Colorado. I'm a maker, software engineer, community leader, creator of tasty meals and experiences.

I've had the pleasure of being a part of some outstanding communities of people and great companies that have taught me much along the way. I've built software for millions of users, led teams of engineers, built large scale public art, and helped to create and grow communities of people who are passionate about technology and art.

This site is a collection of past experiences, current projects and new explorations.
