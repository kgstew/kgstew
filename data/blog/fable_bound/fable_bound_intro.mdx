## Animatronic Viking Ship Replica

Between November of 2023 and October of 2024 I led a team of volunteers to build the largest and most complex piece of art I have completed to date. This will be one of many posts on Fable Bound so lets start at the beginning.

Fable Bound started with an idea driving out of Burning Man 2023. Leanne and I were throwing out concepts for art pieces we could build, as you do after a week of creative inspiration. We had just finished watching Vikings on Netflix and listening to "The Twilight of the Aesir" from Dan Carlin so we were steeped in Viking stories. The ship was by far the most fun of the ideas we came up with and quickly set in as a concept to run with.

    I spent a few months talking through ideas with friends and family. We knew we wanted the ship
    to move and we wanted it to be an interactive installation. The initial idea was a seesaw where
    rowing oars on the ship would move the ship up and down using a hydraulic system. Though we
    didn't know exactly how this was going to come together we had enough of a concept to apply for
    the Burning Man Honoraria and see if we could get some funding help.

Leanne and I were taking a much needed and long vacation from work at the end of 2023 and the initial
3D Models, project plan, budget and story were drafted on an iPad while flying between counties in Southeast
Asia. I taught myself enough 3D Modeling using [Shaper3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/). Not as full featured
as Fusion 360, Rhino or SolidWorks but powerful enough that I could model the basics of the ship on my
iPad and make some models to include in the proposal.

    The first big success was starting to pull the team together before we submitted the proposal.
    Leanne, Alex (Maki), Nathan (Half Hour), and William (Willow) were all on board with a starting
    skill set that gave me confidence we would figure out how to build the ship. I can't stress
    enough how important having a strong crew is for a large volunteer project like this. Not just
    having people with skills who could make the project easier but working with people who make the
    project fun.

I don't remember how many pages of application forms we had to fill out for the Honoraria application. There are two parts, a Letter of Intent and then a full proposal if accepted to the second round. I called around to anyone I knew who had submitted a proposal in the past and tried to get as much information as I could about what the Org was looking for in a submission. I also sent out the proposal to several friends and family members for editing, review and feedback. More eyes was helpful in refining and condensing the information.

We got the announcement that we were being awarded a grant for 40% of the project budget on December 21st, 2023. Happy birthday to me! Soon back in Denver in January we got started on initial prototyping on the most complex pieces of the build, the pneumatics and hardware controls for the ship movement. I always like to start a new project with the most complex pieces first. This helps answer the questions about what you don't know and get a better idea of how long something is actually going to take. To me, the movement was also the most important piece of the entire build.
