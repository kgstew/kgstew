## Distributed temporary seastead and party

Ephemerisle is a yearly gathering in the Stockton river delta. A place and time for water faring attendees to self-organize, indepentendly goverened islands and archipelagos of boats, platforms and improvised floating craft. I participated in and led the build team for the largest of these archipelagos, Elysium, from 2016-2018. We built infrastructure for 350+ people to camp, live and party on a ramshackle collection of floating objects and docks.

Spending two weeks on the water at a time and enjoying the challenges that come with keep structures together through weather, currents and tide changes. This kind of event creates close friendships very quickly and was a defining community creation moment in my life.

With my partner at the time, Brittany Ferrero, we built an Alice in Wonderland inspired art boat. Complete with a surrelistic living room, real grass floating lawn, full kitchen and space for 6 camping spots on the roof.
