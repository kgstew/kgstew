## Free community created third space

The [freespace] movement is an experiment in what is possible when a community shares the gift of physical space. A [freespace] is a gathering place for people to come together, to create, teach, learn, and share the things which they are truly passionate about, and strengthen connections between individuals as well as communities through art, events, and long term projects.

[freespace] began in June 2013, inspired by the National Day of Civic Hacking when a building was gifted to the community for just $1. The radically low barrier to entry and open door policy lead to a hugely diverse range of people from different cultural, economic, and professional backgrounds connecting and creating projects together such as a free bike share, maker classes for people in homeless shelters, and a community garden.

Over a three month period, the original [freespace] hosted over 300 free events, was visited by more than 10,000 people, seen more than 30 murals, fostered 4 long-term projects within San Francisco, and instigated an immeasurable amount of inspiration, collaboration, and solidarity within the communities it has touched.

[freespace] is now a global movement. Currently there are [freespaces] developing in 26 locations and 18 different countries around the world.

I was one of the founding members and deeply involved in the facilitation an ongoing day to day operations of the original space and [freespace] 2.0, also in San Francisco .
